Since we are considering to execute this program directly on command line, it is advisable to have  a java 1.8+ version and maven 3.3.6+ version.

I am using a docker container with preinstalled dependencies to make my program run hostOS independent.

Build Image with below command:
 Â   docker build -t jpmc-project .


Then execute the Maven Build:
    mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip
    
    
And then after the build artifacts are generated, we can see the Selling and Buying report generated with a sample data year 2018 using:
    java -jar target/report-engine.jar -IRR (Inward Ranked Report)
    java -jar target/report-engine.jar -ISR (Inward trade report
    java -jar target/report-engine.jar -ORR (Outward Ranked Report)
    java -jar target/report-engine.jar -OSR (Outward trade Report)
